# An e-commerce web application

An e-commerce web application for listing products for users, adding products to the shopping cart, and making orders dealing with fake restful APIs built for training purposes.


Technologies, tools and libraries used in this project: 
- React.js with the latest features and patterns including React hooks.
- Redux for handling the global state for the user info and user shopping cart.
- Axios for dealing with backend APIs with an instance and some interceptors on requests and responses.

It's not over yet. I'm gonna add some additional features shortly.

Waiting for your feedback.
